In grasping and object manipulation it is important to know what the force interactions are between robot gripper and object. Fundamentally, we make use of friction in order to grasp an object and exert arbitrary forces on the object. One one extreme if we the contact point was glued then we can exert whatever amount of force we want from the gripper to the object. But because this is normally not the case we need to know about the dynamics of frictional contact. 

## Friction from Contact Point
We have motivated now that it is important to analyze the frictional forces at the contact points and understand how much force we can apply and under what conditions. To start off, a simple model for contact is a point contact. That is, a point through which only shear and normal forces can be transmitted.
